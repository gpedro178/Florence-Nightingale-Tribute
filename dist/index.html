    <p>Florence Nightingale (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910) was an English social reformer, statistician and the founder of modern nursing. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers. She gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture.
    </p>
    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated 2020 as the “International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife”, in honor of the 200th anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth. This may not seem significant to countries where nursing is ranked as an important profession but in many countries, nurses and midwives are considered less important and treated with less respect.
    </p>
    <p>We honor Florence Nightingale because she is an icon of equality among healthcare professionals and her work inspire us to make a difference today.
